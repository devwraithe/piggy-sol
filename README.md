# üê∑ Piggy-Sol

Piggy-Sol is a simple on-chain savings program built on Solana using Anchor. Each user can create their own savings account, deposit SOL into it, and withdraw later ‚Äî all managed transparently through program logic.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to deposit funds into Piggy-Sol, so that it can be securely saved on-chain for later.
- As a user, I want to view my Piggy-Sol balance so that I can see how much I've saved.
- As a user, I want to withdraw my saved funds anytime, so that I can get immediate access to my funds.
- As a user, I want to have sole access over my Piggy-Sol so that I alone can withdraw my funds.
